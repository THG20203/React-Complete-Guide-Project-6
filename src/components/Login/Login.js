//useReducer - basic structure:
/* const [state, dispatchFn] = useReducer(reducerFn, intialState, initFn) */

// Explanation of function above:
// left hand side of function
/* state snapshot = used in the component re-render/ re-evaluation cycle */
/* dispatchFn -> can be used to dispatch a new action (i.e. trigger an an update of the state) */
/* this first part -> similar as for useState() -> though the state updating function will work
differently. */
/* Instead of just setting a new state value, you will dispatch an action -> and that action will
be consumed by the first argument you pass to useReducer - a so-called reducer function. */

// right hand side of function
/* preducerFn -> (prevState, action) => newState. 
A function that is triggered that is triggered automatically once an action is dispatched (via 
dispatchFun()) - it recieves the latest state snapshot and should return the new updated state. */
/* In addition, you can also set some initial state and also an initial function, in case your 
initial state is a bit more complex. A function to set the initial state programmatically. And for example,
the result of lets say HTTP requests */

note -> reducer function created outside of the component function. Did so, because inside of this 
reducer function, we won't need any data thats generated inside of the component function. */

component function -> does need to interact with anything defined inside of the componetn function. */

  the dispatchEmail function. */
