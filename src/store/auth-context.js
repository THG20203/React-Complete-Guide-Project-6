//NOTES ABOUT auth-context

/* So now we can import this specific Context object. Then use Context in your app, I
need to do two things. 
1) Need to provide it, which basically tells React, "Hey, here's my Context" . All components that 
are wrapped by it should have access to it. 
2) Besides providing, you then need to consume it. You need to hook into it, you need to listen to 
it if you want to call it like this. */
/* Providing is always the first step. Providing means you wrap in JSX code all the components that
the components that should be able to tap into that Context - so should be able to listen to that
context. */
/* Any component thats not wrapped will not be able to listen */
